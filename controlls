Hi when you play this demo there are somethings that you should know to make it easier to use.

download the zip and run the EXE file

the controlls are:

keyboard A: if you want to choose the first option.
keyboard S: if you want to choose the second option.
keyboard D: if you want to choose the third option.
keyboard F: if you want to choose the fourth option.

SPACEBAR: when your done reading the dialog pres space and the next dialog wil start 

in the score screens are no interactions its just to let you see the progres.
